# VR-experiment-Game
My first VR experiment game

This game is tested for Oculus Quest 2 VR headset.

This is a group project. I did all of the coding for this project.

Here is a link for my google drive, if you wish to try it : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f7W6877W-ssLi4aV2VKvkS7JsCey7zRJ/view?usp=sharing

In the game you go in a cargo ship's command bridge and press a button to activate enemy planes to spawn. Then you can go outside and pick up a laser pointer.
The laser pointer controls a turret and you can shoot the enemy planes.
